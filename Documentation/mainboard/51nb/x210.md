# 51NB X210

The X210 is a third party replacement motherboard for Thinkpad X200/X201
devices, including a modern CPU and support for NVMe. Four batches were
produced - batches 1-3 are compatible with each other, but the fourth batch
includes a more modern CPU (10th gen Intel rather than 8th gen), USB-C
instead of mini-DisplayPort, and a 16MB firmware image rather than
8MB. Boards from the fourth batch are referred to as "X2100" rather than
"X210". The X2100 is not compatible with X210 firmware (or vice versa), and
the appropriate variant must be chosen.

## Extracting vendor EC firmware

EC firmware is included in the SPI image, but the location differs between
X210 and X2100 systems. To extract it, run:

### For X210:
```
dd bs=64K skip=32 count=1 if=bios.rom of=ec.bin
```

### For X2100:
```
dd bs=64K skip=64 count=1 if=bios.rom of=ec.bin
```

and ensure that you have a file that includes the string "Insyde Software Corp".

## Flashing instructions

This can be performed using the internal SPI controller, even when flashing
from stock firmware. Use `flashrom -p internal` and follow the appropriate
flashrom instructions to force it. Alternatively, external flashing has been
tested with Dediprog SF100 and SF600 and using a Beaglebone Black. The flash
is located on the upper side of the motherboard, below the keyboard
connector. It is circled in red here:

## Flashing a subset of the ROM

If you want to flash coreboot without extracting firmware blobs, you can
flash coreboot without overwriting those blobs. After building coreboot,
create a layout file with the following content, again differing between
X210 and X2100:

### For X210
```
00000000:001fffff me
00200000:0020ffff ec
00210000:007fffff main
```

### For X2100
```
00000000:003fffff me
00400000:0040ffff ec
00410000:00ffffff main
```

and run flashrom with the `--layout rom.layout --image main` arguments. This
will flash the main firmware without overwriting the existing EC or ME
firmware.

## Working

All hardware features are believed to be working, although the SD reader is
untested. Note that certain hotkeys don't work (including the ThinkVantage
button) - this is a limitation of the EC firmware, and these keys also
generate no events under the stock vendor firmware.
