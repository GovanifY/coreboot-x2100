	  Selecting this option will increase the payload size in CBFS by ~220KB.

config TIANOCORE_BOOTSPLASH_IMAGE
	bool "Use a custom bootsplash image"

	  Select this option if you have a bootsplash image that you would

	default "bootsplash.bmp"
	help
	  The path and filename of the file to use as graphical bootsplash
	  image. The file must be an uncompressed BMP.

	  This image will also be used as the BGRT boot image, which may
	  persist through your OS boot process, and will be displayed
	  vertically centered 38.2% from the top of the display.

	  See ACPI spec 6.3, 5.2.22 Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT), and
	  Microsoft's documentation on BGRT positioning:
	  Docs/Windows/Windows Drivers/Bring up guide/Boot screen components

	  Accordingly, the image used should be no taller/wider than 40% of
	  the display panel's native pixel height/width (or resolution set).

	  If an absolute path is not given, the path will assumed to be
	  relative to the coreboot root directory.

config TIANOCORE_ABOVE_4G_MEMORY
	bool "Enable above 4G memory"
	default n
	help
	  Select this option to enable Above 4G Decode. This will allow the
	  payload to use all of the memory, rather than an maximum of 4G.

	  Disabling this option, which will reserve memory above 4G, is
	  useful for bootloaders that are not fully 64-bit aware such as
	  Qubes R4.0.4 bootloader.
